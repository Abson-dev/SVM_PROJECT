We will take the case of a pregnancy test that classifies each individual in the population as pregnant (positive) or non-pregnant (negative).

* True Positive (TP) - a person considered pregnant when this is the case
* True Negative (TN) - a person considered as non-pregnant when this is the case
* False Negative (FN) - a person considered non-pregnant while pregnant
* False Positive (FP) - a person considered pregnant when not pregnant


| Sensitivity / Recall | Specificity | Precision | F1 |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified by a pregnancy test. It shows how good the test is at detecting pregnancy | Specificity is the proportion of true negatives correctly identified by a pregnancy test. It indicates how good the test is at identifying a normal (negative) condition. | Measuring how many of those that were positively rated were relevant. A test can maximize precision by returning positive for only one result to which it is most reliable. | The weighted average of accuracy (positive predicted value) and recall (sensitivity). It is also known as F-score or F-measure. |
| $$ Sensitivity = Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$ | $$Specificity = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}$$ | $$Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$ | $$F1 = \frac {2*(Precision * Rappel)} {Precision + Rappel} $$ |


| Accuracy | AUC | Gini | Loss |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Accuracy is the proportion of true results, whether true positive or true negative, in a population.  It measures the degree of reliability of a pregnancy test. | The AUC is the area under the ROC curve. The higher the AUC, the better the classification accuracy of the model. | A measure of the quality of the model. It has values between -1 and 1, closer to 1 is better. It is also known as Somer's D. | The loss function is a statistical model used to calculate the "cost" (loss) to the company based on possible events. The lower the loss, the better the model. |
| $$Accuracy= \frac{TN+TP}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$$ |  | $$ Gini = 2 * AUC -1$$ | |
