As the results in the comparaison tab shows, the highest accuracy is given by the SVM algorithm when applied all algorithms with SMOTE data balancing technique. 
<p>These results are obtained with a sample of 10086 observations (8118 no-fraud and 1968 fraud).</p>

*The SMOTE technique (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) creates a bias, but you choose how this bias is created and therefore how it will affect your data. It allows your algorithm to retrieve useful information.*

               style = 'position:absolute; bottom:1; right:0; padding:10px;width:2cm')
